## Description

I'd like to learn web technologies like Shadow DOM, IndexedDB, and FlexBox. This repository is a vehicle for doing so.
It contains my source code, instructions, notes and plans.

## Standalone sub-projects

This repository illustrates different concepts, patterns and examples via standalone sub-projects. Each sub-project is
completely independent of the others and do not depend on the root project. This _standalone sub-project constraint_
forces the sub-projects to be complete and maximizes the reader's chances of successfully running, understanding, and
re-using the code.

The sub-projects include:

### `shadow-dom/`

A Shadow DOM example.

See the README in [shadow-dom/](shadow-dom/).

## Wish List

General clean ups, TODOs and things I wish to implement for this project:

* DONE Implement a Shadow DOM example
* Implement an IndexedDB example

## Reference

Materials that I referenced and found useful while developing this project:

* [MDN Web Docs: *IndexedDB API*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API)
