# css

Learning CSS snippet-by-snippet and hopefully committing some of it to memory.

And even if I can't commit it to memory, at least I can refer to these examples!

## Instructions

* Run a local web server:
    * `python3 -m http.server --directory src/`
* Open the browser
    * Open the browser and navigate to <http://localhost:8000>

## Reference
